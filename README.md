# The Peet Buster

Go and bust the Peet's out there! We can't let them win ✊🏿

## Note

Until the program isn't installable, you just have to copy the _peet_buster.sh_ file into the directory you want to, and run:

	sh peet_buster.sh NAME_OF_WHO_YOU_WANNA_BUST

## To-do

Make a shell command out of this. Expectations, something like this:

	peet_bust NAME_OF_WHO_YOU_WANNA_BUST
